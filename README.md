I'm chuulu mainda also known as a last level tech niger, a Zambian-based freelance developer. I craft lines of code into user friendly, beautiful, multi-functional and mostly importantly easy to use applications for the web (websites), among others. My main tools are PHP, MYSQL, phython, HTML, CSS and Javascript among many others. As both an engineer and designer I help people bring their ideas into reality (My Work), as I craft them uniquely to their preferences. Contact Me today, I would be glad to hear from you.
